                    <p>
                        Data transmitted over an internet using IP is carried in messages called IP datagrams. Like all network protocol messages, IP uses a specific format for its datagrams. 
                        <div style="text-align: center">
                            <img src="https://www.rhyshaden.com/images/tcpip_c.gif" class="img-fluid"><br>
                        </div>
                        Description:<br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>VERS -</b>is the IP version number (currently binary 0100 (4), but can now also be version 6). All nodes must use the same version.</li>
                            <li><b>HLEN -</b>header length in 32-bit words, so if the number is 6, then 6 x 32 bit words are in the header i.e. 24 bytes. The maximum size is 15 x 32-bit words which is 60 bytes. The minimum size is 20 bytes or 5 x 32-bit words.</li>
                            <li><b>Type of Service -</b>is how the datagram should be used, e.g. delay, precedence, reliability, minimum cost, throughput etc. This TOS field is now used by Differentiated Services and is called the Diff Serv Code Point (DSCP).</li>
                            <li><b>Total Length -</b>is the number of octets that the IP datagram takes up including the header. The maximum size that an IP datagram can be is 65,535 octets.</li>
                            <li><b>Identification -</b>The Identification is a unique number assigned to a datagram fragment to help in the reassembly of fragmented datagrams.</li>
                            <li><b>Flags -</b>Bit 0 is always 0 and is reserved. Bit 1 indicates whether a datagram can be fragmented (0) or not (1). Bit 2 indicates to the receiving unit whether the fragment is the last one in the datagram (1) or if there are still more fragments to come (0).</li>
                            <li><b>Frag Offset -</b>in units of 8 octets (64 bits) this specifies a value for each data fragment in the reassembly process. Different sized Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs) can be used throughout the Internet.</li>
                            <li><b>TTL -</b>the time that the datagram is allowed to exist on the network. A router that processes the packet decrements this by one. Once the value reaches 0, the packet is discarded.</li>
                            <li><b>Protocol -</b>Layer 4 protocol sending the datagram, UDP uses the number 17, TCP uses 6, ICMP uses 1, IGRP uses 88 and OSPF uses 89.</li>
                            <li><b>Header Checksum -</b>error control for the header only.</li>
                            <li><b>IP Options -</b>this field is for testing, debugging and security.</li>
                            <li><b>Padding -</b>there is padding added sometimes just to make sure that the datagram is confined within a 32 bit boundary in multiples of 32 bits.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="two">ICMP - Types of Messages</h4>
                    <p>
                        Since IP does not have an inbuilt mechanism for sending error and control messages. It depends on Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP) to provide an error control. It is used for reporting errors and management queries. It is a supporting protocol and is used by networks devices like routers for sending error messages and operations information., e.g. the requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached. <br>
                        ICMP messages are mainly divided into two categories :<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Error reporting messages</li>
                            <li>Query messages</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div style="text-align: center">
                            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211020093430/icmp.PNG" class="img-fluid"><br>
                        </div>
                        <span><b>1. Error Reporting Messages :</b></span><br>
                        <p>Error Reporting Messages are used to report problems encountered by the router/host while processing the IP packets. These messages are always sent to the source because the datagram only contains the source and destination IP address.</p>
                        <span><b>2. Query Messages :</b></span><br>
                        <p>Query Messages are used for error handling and debugging network problems. These messages help the host to get specific information about another host or router.</p>
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="three">BOOTP and DHCP</h4>
                    <h4>BOOTP</h4>
                    <p>
                        BOOTP stands for Bootstrap Protocol and DHCP stands for Dynamic host configuration protocol. These protocols square measure used for getting the information science address of the host alongside the bootstrap info. The operating of each protocol is totally different in some manner. Dynamic host configuration protocol is also the extended version of the Bootstrap Protocol. <br>
                        <b>Important Features of Bootstrap Protocol :</b>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a basic protocol that automatically provides each participant in a network connection with a unique IP address for identification and authentication as soon as it connects to the network. This helps the server to speed up data transfers and connection requests.</li>
                            <li>BOOTP uses a unique IP address algorithm to provide each system on the network with a completely different IP address in a fraction of a second.</li>
                            <li>This shortens the connection time between the server and the client. It starts the process of downloading and updating the source code even with very little information.</li>
                            <li>BOOTP uses a combination of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to request and receive requests from various network-connected participants and to handle their responses.</li>
                            <li>In a BOOTP connection, the server and client just need an IP address and a gateway address to establish a successful connection. Typically, in a BOOTP network, the server and client share the same LAN, and the routers used in the network must support BOOTP bridging.</li>
                            <li>A great example of a network with a TCP / IP configuration is the Bootstrap Protocol network. Whenever a computer on the network asks for a specific request to the server, BOOTP uses its unique IP address to quickly resolve them.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h4>DHCP</h4>
                    <p>
                        Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used to dynamically assign an IP address to nay device, or node, on a network so they can communicate using IP (Internet Protocol). DHCP automates and centrally manages these configurations. There is no need to manually assign IP addresses to new devices. Therefore, there is no requirement for any user configuration to connect to a DHCP based network.<br>

                        DHCP can be implemented on local networks as well as large enterprise networks. DHCP is the default protocol used by the most routers and networking equipment. DHCP is also called RFC (Request for comments) 2131.<br>
                        
                    </p>
                    <b>DHCP does the following:</b>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>DHCP manages the provision of all the nodes or devices added or dropped from the network.</li>
                            <li>DHCP maintains the unique IP address of the host using a DHCP server.</li>
                            <li>It sends a request to the DHCP server whenever a client/node/device, which is configured to work with DHCP, connects to a network. The server acknowledges by providing an IP address to the client/node/device.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="four">Routing Protocol</h4>
                    <p>
                        Routing Protocols are the set of defined rules used by the routers to communicate between source & destination. They do not move the information to the source to a destination, but only update the routing table that contains the information.<br>

                        Network Router protocols helps you to specify way routers communicate with each other. It allows the network to select routes between any two nodes on a computer network.

                        <b>Types of Routing Protocols</b><br>
                        There are mainly two types of Network Routing Protocols<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Static</li>
                            <li>Dynamic</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div style="text-align: center">
                            <img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2/102020_0511_RoutingProt1.png" class="img-fluid"><br>
                        </div>
                        <b>Static Routing Protocols</b><br>
                        Static routing protocols are used when an administrator manually assigns the path from source to the destination network. It offers more security to the network.<br>
                        <b>Dynamic Routing Protocols</b><br>
                        Dynamic routing protocols are another important type of routing protocol. It helps routers to add information to their routing tables from connected routers automatically. These types of protocols also send out topology updates whenever the network changes’ topological structure.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="five">RIP, OSPF, BGP</h4>
                    <h4>RIP</h4>
                    <p>
                        Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a dynamic routing protocol that uses hop count as a routing metric to find the best path between the source and the destination network. It is a distance-vector routing protocol that has an AD value of 120 and works on the Network layer of the OSI model. RIP uses port number 520. <br>
                        <b>How is hop count determined?</b><br>When the router sends the packet to the network segment, then it is counted as a single hop.
                        <div style="text-align: center">
                            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/rip-protocol.png" class="img-fluid"><br>
                        </div>
                        In the above figure, when the router 1 forwards the packet to the router 2 then it will count as 1 hop count. Similarly, when the router 2 forwards the packet to the router 3 then it will count as 2 hop count, and when the router 3 forwards the packet to router 4, it will count as 3 hop count. In the same way, RIP can support maximum upto 15 hops, which means that the 16 routers can be configured in a RIP.<br>
                        <b>Features of RIP </b><br>
                        1. Updates of the network are exchanged periodically. <br>
                        2. Updates (routing information) are always broadcast. <br>
                        3. Full routing tables are sent in updates. <br>
                        4. Routers always trust routing information received from neighbor routers. This is also known as Routing on rumors. <br>
                    </p>
                    <h4>OSPF</h4>
                    <p>
                        The OSPF stands for Open Shortest Path First. It is a widely used and supported routing protocol. It is an intradomain protocol, which means that it is used within an area or a network. It is an interior gateway protocol that has been designed within a single autonomous system. It is based on a link-state routing algorithm in which each router contains the information of every domain, and based on this information, it determines the shortest path. The goal of routing is to learn routes. The OSPF achieves by learning about every router and subnet within the entire network. Every router contains the same information about the network. The way the router learns this information by sending LSA (Link State Advertisements). These LSAs contain information about every router, subnet, and other networking information. Once the LSAs have been flooded, the OSPF stores the information in a link-state database known as LSDB. The main goal is to have the same information about every router in an LSDBs.
                    </p>
                    <b>OSPF Areas</b>
                    <div style="text-align: center">
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/ospf-protocol.png" class="img-fluid"><br>
                    </div>
                    OSPF divides the autonomous systems into areas where the area is a collection of networks, hosts, and routers. Like internet service providers divide the internet into a different autonomous system for easy management and OSPF further divides the autonomous systems into Areas.<br>
                    Routers that exist inside the area flood the area with routing information.<br>
                    In Area, the special router also exists. The special routers are those that are present at the border of an area, and these special routers are known as Area Border Routers. This router summarizes the information about an area and shares the information with other areas.<br>
                    All the areas inside an autonomous system are connected to the backbone routers, and these backbone routers are part of a primary area. The role of a primary area is to provide communication between different areas.
                    <h4>BGP</h4>
                    <p>
                        Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to Exchange routing information for the internet and is the protocol used between ISP which are different ASes.<br>
                        The protocol can connect together any internetwork of autonomous system using an arbitrary topology. The only requirement is that each AS have at least one router that is able to run BGP and that is router connect to at least one other AS’s BGP router. BGP’s main function is to exchange network reach-ability information with other BGP systems. Border Gateway Protocol constructs an autonomous systems’ graph based on the information exchanged between BGP routers.<br>
                        <b>Characteristics of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP):</b>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inter-Autonomous System Configuration: The main role of BGP is to provide communication between two autonomous systems.</li>
