                        <h4>What is Image?</h4>
                        <p>An image is a picture that has been created or copied and stored in electronic form.</p><br>
                        <h4>What is Digital Image?</h4>
                        <p>An image is defined as a two-dimensional function,F(x,y), where x and y are spatial coordinates, and the amplitude of F at any pair of coordinates (x,y) is called the intensity of that image at that point. When x,y, and amplitude values of F are finite, we call it a digital image. </p>
                        <p>
                        In other words, an image can be defined by a two-dimensional array specifically arranged in rows and columns. 
                        Digital Image is composed of a finite number of elements, each of which elements have a particular value at a particular location.These elements are referred to as picture elements,image elements,and pixels.A Pixel is most widely used to denote the elements of a Digital Image.
                        </p><br>
                        <h4>What is Digital Image processing?</h4>
                        <p>
                        Digital image processing is the use of a digital computer to process digital images through an algorithm.
                            <br>or<br>
                            Digital Image Processing means processing digital image by means of a digital computer. We can also say that it is a use of computer algorithms, in order to get enhanced image either to extract some useful information.

                                <p>Image acquisition is the first step of the fundamental steps of DIP. In this stage, an image is given in the digital form. Generally, in this stage, pre-processing such as scaling is done.</p>
                                <b>2. Image Enhancement</b><br>
                                <p>Image enhancement is the simplest and most attractive area of DIP. In this stage details which are not known, or we can say that interesting features of an image is highlighted. Such as brightness, contrast, etc.</p>
                                <b>3. Image Restoration</b><br>
                                <p>Image restoration is the stage in which the appearance of an image is improved.</p><br>
                                <b>4. Color Image Processing</b><br>
                                <p>Color image processing is a famous area because it has increased the use of digital images on the internet. This includes color modeling, processing in a digital domain, etc.</p>
                                <b>5. Wavelets and Multi-Resolution Processing</b><br>
                                <p>In this stage, an image is represented in various degrees of resolution. Image is divided into smaller regions for data compression and for the pyramidal representation.</p>
                                <b>6. Compression</b><br>
                                <p>Compression is a technique which is used for reducing the requirement of storing an image. It is a very important stage because it is very necessary to compress data for internet use.</p>
                                <b>7. Morphological Processing</b><br>
                                <p>This stage deals with tools which are used for extracting the components of the image, which is useful in the representation and description of shape.</p>
                                <b>8. Segmentation</b><br>
                                <p>In this stage, an image is a partitioned into its objects. Segmentation is the most difficult tasks in DIP. It is a process which takes a lot of time for the successful solution of imaging problems which requires objects to identify individually.</p>
                                <b>9. Representation and Description</b><br>
                                <p>Representation and description follow the output of the segmentation stage. The output is a raw pixel data which has all points of the region itself. To transform the raw data, representation is the only solution. Whereas description is used for extracting information's to differentiate one class of objects from another.</p>
                                <b>10. Object recognition</b><br>
                                <p>In this stage, the label is assigned to the object, which is based on descriptors.</p>
                                <b>11. Knowledge Base</b><br>
                                <p>Knowledge is the last stage in DIP. In this stage, important information of the image is located, which limits the searching processes. The knowledge base is very complex when the image database has a high-resolution satellite.</p>

                    <p>Visual perception is the brain's ability to receive, interpret, and act upon visual stimuli. <br>The field of digital image processing is built on the foundation of mathematical and probabilistic formulation, but human <span class="toolTip top">intuition </span>and analysis play the main role to make the selection between various techniques, and the choice or selection is basically made on subjective, visual judgements. <br>

                    In human visual perception, the eyes act as the sensor or camera, neurons act as the connecting cable and the brain acts as the processor.<br>
                    The basic elements of visual perceptions are:

                        <li>Structure of Eye</li>
                        <li>Image Formation in the Eye</li>
                        <li>Brightness Adaptation and Discrimination</li>
                    </ol>
        </p>
                    <h4>Structure of Eye:</h4>
                    <p>
                         
                        <div style="text-align: center">
                           
                        <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20191223004801/gfg_eye.png" class="img-fluid eye">
</div><br>
                        The human eye is a slightly asymmetrical sphere with an average diameter of the length of 20mm to 25mm. It has a volume of about 6.5cc. The eye is just like a camera. The external object is seen as the camera take the picture of any object. Light enters the eye through a small hole called the pupil, a black looking aperture having the quality of contraction of eye when exposed to bright light and is focused on the retina which is like a camera film. <br>

The lens, iris, and cornea are nourished by clear fluid, know as anterior chamber. The fluid flows from ciliary body to the pupil and is absorbed through the channels in the angle of the anterior chamber. The delicate balance of aqueous production and absorption controls pressure within the eye. 
<br>
Cones in eye number between 6 to 7 million which are highly sensitive to colors. Human visualizes the colored image in daylight due to these cones. The cone vision is also called as photopic or bright-light vision. 
<br>
Rods in the eye are much larger between 75 to 150 million and are distributed over the retinal surface. Rods are not involved in the color vision and are sensitive to low levels of illumination. 
                    </p>
        <h4>Image Formation in the Eye: </h4>
        
                    <p>When the lens of the eye focus an image of the outside world onto a light-sensitive membrane in the back of the eye, called retina the image is formed. The lens of the eye focuses light on the photoreceptive cells of the retina which detects the photons of light and responds by producing neural impulses.

</div><br>
The distance between the lens and the retina is about 17mm and the focal length is approximately 14mm to 17mm. 
</p>
<h4>Brightness Adaptation and Discrimination: </h4>
<p>Digital images are displayed as a discrete set of intensities. The eyes ability to discriminate black and white at different intensity levels is an important consideration in presenting image processing result. 
<div style="text-align: center">

The range of light intensity levels to which the human visual system can adapt is of the order of 10<sup>10</sup> from the scotopic threshold to the glare limit. In a photopic vision, the range is about 10<sup>6</sup>.
