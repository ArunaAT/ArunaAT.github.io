                    <p>
                        Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component that is present on the computer. It is used to connect different networking devices such as computers and servers to share data over the connected network. It provides functionality such as support for I/O interrupt, Direct Memory Access (DMA) interfaces, partitioning, and data transmission.<br>
                        NIC is important for us to establish a wired or wireless connection over the network.<br>
                        Network Interface Card is also known as Network Interface Controller, Network Adapter, Ethernet card, Connection card, and LAN (Local Area Network) Adapter.<br>
                        <b>Types of NIC Cards</b><br>NIC cards are of two types −<br>

                        <b>1. Internal Network Cards</b><p>In internal networks cards, motherboard has a slot for the network card where it can be inserted. It requires network cables to provide network access. Internal network cards are of two types. The first type uses Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) connection, while the second type uses Industry Standard Architecture (ISA).</p>
                        <b>2. External Network Cards</b><p>In desktops and laptops that do not have an internal NIC, external NICs are used. External network cards are of two types: Wireless and USB based. Wireless network card needs to be inserted into the motherboard, however no network cable is required to connect to the network. They are useful while traveling or accessing a wireless signal.</p>

                    <h4 id="two">Ethernet Technology</h4>
                    <p>
                        Ethernet is the traditional technology for connecting devices in a wired local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). It enables devices to communicate with each other via a protocol, which is a set of rules or common network language.
                    </p>
                    <h4>10Base 2</h4>
                    <p>
                        10Base2 is among the family of Ethernet network standards for local area networks (LAN) that uses a thinner version of coaxial cable to establish a network path or medium and operates at a speed of 10 Mbps to carry out baseband transmission.<br>
                        10Base2 is also known as cheapernet, thinwire, thinnet and thin Ethernet.<br>
                        10Base2 use RG- 58 A/U coaxial cable that is thinner, flexible, cheaper and comparatively easier to install than cable used in 10Base5 standard. The maximum cable length within a 10Base2 is 200 meters, but 185 meter is a preferred length. The maximum number of nodes that can connect within a 10Base2 network segment is 30.<br>
                        10Base2 use BNC T-connector to join two cables together and to connect with the computer’s network interface card (NIC). Moreover, the cable must be terminated with a 50 ohm resistant at each end.
                    </p>     
                    <h4>10Base 5</h4>  
                     <p>
                        10Base5 refers to a standard for Ethernet network technologies that use a thicker version of coaxial cables. It has the capability to transmit data at speed of 10Mbps up to 500 meters using baseband transmission.<br>
                        10Base5 is also known as Thicknet, ThickWire, thick Ethernet and thick coaxial Ethernet.<br>
                        The 10Base5 is among the first of original standards of Ethernet along with 10Base2. The name 10Base5 is derived from its 10Mbps transmission speed and 500 meters as the maximum segment length. Its coaxial cable is similar to RG-8/U but with a much thicker shield and braiding, making it highly resistant to network interference. Its outer sheath even has the ability to resist and protect against fire.<br>
                        A 10Base5 network segment (LAN) can consist of a maximum of 100 nodes. Each node connects to the network segment or cable using an N-connector and must have a distance of 2.5m between one another. Nodes can also be connected through a vampire clam that enables adding a new node in a live network.
                     </p>
                     <h4>10Base T</h4>
                     <p>
                        An Ethernet standard that transmits at 10 Mbps over twisted wire pairs (telephone wire). 10Base-T was the first version of Ethernet to use a star architecture. When used with a hub, 10Base-T shares the 10 Mbps bandwidth between all the ports. When used with a switch, each transmit/receive pair has the full 10 Mbps.<br>

                        There are rarely new products that are 10Base-T only. Most Ethernet adapters, hubs and switches are 10/100/1000 devices, which support 10, 100 and 1000 Mbps (10Base-T, 100Base-T and 1000Base-T).
                     </p>
                    <h4 id="three">Network Device Router</h4>       
                    <p>
                        The router is a physical or virtual internetworking device that is designed to receive, analyze, and forward data packets between computer networks. A router examines a destination IP address of a given data packet, and it uses the headers and forwarding tables to decide the best way to transfer the packets.<br>
                        A router works on the third layer of the OSI model, and it is based on the IP address of a computer. It uses protocols such as ICMP to communicate between two or more networks. It is also known as an intelligent device as it can calculate the best route to pass the network packets from source to the destination automatically.<br>
                        A router is more capable as compared to other network devices, such as a hub, switch, etc., as these devices are only able to execute the basic functions of the network. For example, a hub is a basic networking device that is mainly used to forward the data between connected devices, but it cannot analyze or change anything with the transferring data. On the other hand, the router has the capability to analyze and modify the data while transferring it over a network, and it can send it to another network. For example, generally, routers allow sharing a single network connection between multiple devices.<br>

                    <h4>Switch </h4>
                    <p>
                        A network switch is a computer networking device that connects various devices together on a single computer network. It may also be used to route information in the form of electronic data sent over networks. Since the process of linking network segments is also called bridging, switches are usually referred to as bridging devices.<br>
                        <b>Types of Switch</b><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Manageable Switches:</b>Manageable switch has a console port and IP address, which can be assigned and configured.</li>
                            <li><b>Unmanageable Switches:</b>On an Unmanageable switch, configuration can’t be made. It is not possible to assign IP address as there is no console port.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>    
                    <h4 id="four">Repeaters</h4>
                    <p>
                        A repeater is a network device that retransmits a received signal with more power and to an extended geographical or topological network boundary than what would be capable with the original signal.<br>

                        A repeater is implemented in computer networks to expand the coverage area of the network, repropagate a weak or broken signal and or service remote nodes. Repeaters amplify the received/input signal to a higher frequency domain so that it is reusable, scalable and available.<br>

                        Repeaters were introduced in wired data communication networks due to the limitation of a signal in propagating over a longer distance and now are a common installation in wireless networks for expanding cell size.<br>

                        Repeaters are also known as signal boosters.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="five">Wireless LAN</h4>
                    <p>
                        Wireless LAN stands for Wireless Local Area Network. It is also called LAWN (Local Area Wireless Network). WLAN is one in which a mobile user can connect to a Local Area Network (LAN) through a wireless connection.<br>
                        The IEEE 802.11 group of standards defines the technologies for wireless LANs. For path sharing, 802.11 standard uses the Ethernet protocol and CSMA/CA (carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance). It also uses an encryption method i.e. wired equivalent privacy algorithm.<br>
                        Wireless LANs provide high speed data communication in small areas such as building or an office. WLANs allow users to move around in a confined area while they are still connected to the network.<br>
                        In some instance wireless LAN technology is used to save costs and avoid laying cable, while in other cases, it is the only option for providing high-speed internet access to the public. Whatever the reason, wireless solutions are popping up everywhere.<br>
                        Examples of WLANs that are available today are NCR's waveLAN and Motorola's ALTAIR.
