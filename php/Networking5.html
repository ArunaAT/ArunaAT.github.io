                    <p>
                        Network Security refers to the measures taken by any enterprise or organisation to secure its computer network and data using both hardware and software systems. This aims at securing the confidentiality and accessibility of the data and network. Every company or organisation that handles large amount of data, has a degree of solutions against many cyber threats. <br>

                        The most basic example of Network Security is password protection where the user of the network oneself chooses. In the recent times, Network Security has become the central topic of cyber security with many organisations inviting applications of people who have skills in this area. The network security solutions protect various vulnerabilities of the computer systems<br><br>
                        <b>Network Security Policy</b><br>
                        A network security policy (NSP) is a generic document that outlines rules for computer network access, determines how policies are enforced and lays out some of the basic architecture of the company security/ network security environment.[1] The document itself is usually several pages long and written by a committee.<br>

                        A security policy is a complex document, meant to govern data access, web-browsing habits, use of passwords, encryption, email attachments and more. It specifies these rules for individuals or groups of individuals throughout the company.[2] The policies could be expressed as a set of instructions that understood by special purpose network hardware dedicated for securing the network.

                    <h4 id="two">Network Security Devices</h4>
                    <p>
                        <span><b>1. Firewalls</b></span><br>
                        <p>
                            Firewalls are network security devices that monitor and ‘curate’ network traffic based on a rigid set of rules. A firewall establishes a protective wall between your internal private network and the global internet.<br>

                            As we’ll see soon enough, firewalls can be both software applications and hardware devices. Hardware firewalls can serve multiple purposes along with network protection, like dynamically assigning identifying IP addresses to devices present in the network.<br>

                            Firewalls are used at the ‘boundary’ of a private network to prevent unauthorized access via the internet. All inbound and outbound messages are scanned by the firewall before they can leave or enter the private network. During the scan, the firewall passes the message (also called as network packet) through a security checklist, which is basically a list of rules that qualify a message as safe. Only if a message checks all the boxes, is it allowed to travel forward.
                        </p>
                        <span><b>2. Content Filtering Devices</b></span><br>
                        <p>
                            Content filtering devices are used to filter out potentially threatening and offensive online content. This includes incoming emails, constant spam, and even websites. As the name suggests, such devices scans the content of online content and verifies its safety by passing it through its own blacklist of words. Some CFDs can also store well-known spam sites and email domains and warn you ahead of time before you interact with them.<br>

                            These devices throw an “Access Denied” error when anyone tries to access unverified, possibly malicious content.<br>

                            The basic configuration of this network security device blocks pornographic or hateful content. But besides, your organization can also block out product selling spam and unwanted newsletters.
                        </p>
                        <span><b>3. Intrusion Detection Systems</b></span><br>
                        <p>
                            Intrusion Detection Systems, often also called Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems, are devices that monitor malicious activities in a network, create a log of such activities, and if a part of their feature set, take steps to stop them. At the very least, an IDS will provide you with insightful reports about your network activity. Using these reports, you can take actions to better your network security.<br>

                            Active intrusion detection systems (the IDPSs) help in raising alarms if malicious network packets attempt to harm your network, forcefully drop the packets, and reset the network channel connection to prevent your network from blocking all subsequent, valid network traffic. If you’re looking for a security partner that can manage your network security devices and squeeze maximum security from them, look no further.<br>

                            Logix provides network security via its firewalls and endpoint security services to protect your devices. We have partnered up with front-runners of network security, like Cisco, Sophos, Fortinet, Trend Micro, and McAfee to provide secure network connections to remote devices.

                    <h4>Viruse</h4>
                    <p>
                        A computer virus is a type of malicious software, or malware, that spreads between computers and causes damage to data and software. <br>

                        Computer viruses aim to disrupt systems, cause major operational issues, and result in data loss and leakage. A key thing to know about computer viruses is that they are designed to spread across programs and systems. Computer viruses typically attach to an executable host file, which results in their viral codes executing when a file is opened. The code then spreads from the document or software it is attached to via networks, drives, file-sharing programs, or infected email attachments.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Worms</h4>
                    <p>
                        A computer worm is a type of malware that spreads copies of itself from computer to computer. A worm can replicate itself without any human interaction, and it does not need to attach itself to a software program in order to cause damage.<br>
                        Worms can be transmitted via software vulnerabilities. Or computer worms could arrive as attachments in spam emails or instant messages (IMs). Once opened, these files could provide a link to a malicious website or automatically download the computer worm. Once it’s installed, the worm silently goes to work and infects the machine without the user’s knowledge.<br>

                        Worms can modify and delete files, and they can even inject additional malicious software onto a computer. Sometimes a computer worm’s purpose is only to make copies of itself over and over — depleting system resources, such as hard drive space or bandwidth, by overloading a shared network. In addition to wreaking havoc on a computer’s resources, worms can also steal data, install a backdoor, and allow a hacker to gain control over a computer and its system settings.

                    <b>How to Prevent Malware Infections </b>
                    <p>
                        You can prevent malware with a variety of techniques:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Install anti-malware software on your devices.</li>
                            <li>Ensure safe user behavior on devices (i.e. avoiding opening attachments from untrusted sources).</li>
                            <li>Keep your anti-malware software updated, so you can benefit from the latest patches.</li>
                            <li>Implement a dual approval process for transactions between different organizations.</li>
                            <li>Implement second-channel verification processes for transactions with customers.</li>
                            <li>Apply threat detection and response procedures to identify malware and prevent it from spreading.</li>
                            <li>Implement robust security policies such as whitelists or allowlists.</li>
                            <li>Implement security at the web browser level.</li>

                    <h4 id="five">Spyware and Spam, Malware Protection</h4><br>
                    <h4>Spyware</h4>
                    <p>
                        Spyware is a type of malicious software -- or malware -- that is installed on a computing device without the end user's knowledge. It invades the device, steals sensitive information and internet usage data, and relays it to advertisers, data firms or external users.<br>

                        Any software can be classified as spyware if it is downloaded without the user's authorization. Spyware is controversial because, even when it is installed for relatively innocuous reasons, it can violate the end user's privacy and has the potential to be abused.<br>

                        Spyware is one of the most common threats to internet users. Once installed, it monitors internet activity, tracks login credentials and spies on sensitive information. The primary goal of spyware is usually to obtain credit card numbers, banking information and passwords.<br>

                        But spyware can also be used to track a person's location, as is the case with stalkerware. Often installed secretly on mobile phones by jealous spouses, ex-partners and even concerned parents, this type of spyware can track the physical location of the victim, intercept their emails and texts, eavesdrop on their phone calls and record conversations, and access personal data, such as photos and videos.<br>

                        Spyware can be difficult to detect; often, the first indication a user has that a computing device has been infected with spyware is a noticeable reduction in processor or network connection speeds and -- in the case of mobile devices -- data usage and battery life. Antispyware tools can be used to prevent or remove spyware. They can either provide real-time protection by scanning network data and blocking malicious data, or they can execute scans to detect and remove spyware already on a system.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Spam</h4>
                    <p>
                        Spam is any kind of unwanted, unsolicited digital communication that gets sent out in bulk. Often spam is sent via email, but it can also be distributed via text messages, phone calls, or social media.<br>
                        Spam is not an acronym for a computer threat, although some have been proposed (stupid pointless annoying malware, for instance). The inspiration for using the term “spam” to describe mass unwanted messages is a Monty Python skit in which the actors declare that everyone must eat the food Spam, whether they want it or not. Similarly, everyone with an email address must unfortunately be bothered by spam messages, whether we like it or not.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Malware Protection</h4>
                    <p>
                        Malicious software (malware) is a program designed to perform malicious activities. For example, malware can be programmed to spy on browser activity, steal financial information, or irreversibly encrypt data and demand a ransom.<br>

                        There are many types of malware—the most common are viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware and adware.<br>
                        The majority of malware attacks are delivered through links to malicious websites or malicious email attachments. Once a user clicks on the link or opens the file, the malware is activated and starts performing the malicious action it was designed for.<br>

                        Malware protection technology can protect against malware attacks using a variety of techniques, including signature-based malware detection, behavior-based malware detection and sandboxing.<br>
