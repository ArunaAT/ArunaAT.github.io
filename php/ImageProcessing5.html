                    <p>
                        The purpose of image restoration is to "compensate for" or "undo" defects which degrade an image. Degradation comes in many forms such as motion blur, noise, and camera misfocus. In cases like motion blur, it is possible to come up with an very good estimate of the actual blurring function and "undo" the blur to restore the original image. In cases where the image is corrupted by noise, the best we may hope to do is to compensate for the degradation it caused.<br>
                        image degradation is a process that acts on an input image f(x,y) through a degradation function H and an additive noise η(x,y). It results in a degraded image g(x,y) such that:
                        <div class="borderr">
                         g(x, y) = h(x, y) + f(x, y) + n(x, y)
                        </div><br>
                        where h(x,y) is the spatial representation of the degradation function and the symbol “ * ” indicates convolution.
                        Note that we only have the degraded image g(x,y). The objective of restoration is to obtain an estimate	of the original image. We want the estimate to be as close as possible to the original input image and, in general, the more we know about H and η, the closer	will be to f(x, y).
                        <div style="text-align: center">
                            <img src="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-image-processing/9781789343731/assets/3e2e5a15-14c6-466f-86a8-e9ac61638065.png" class="img-fluid">
                            </div><br>
                            In the frequency domain, this model is equivalent to:<br><br>
                            <div class="borderr">
                                G(u,v)=H(u,v)F(u,v)+N(u,v)
                            </div><br>
                            The approach that we will study is based on various types of image restoration filters. We assume that H is the identity operator, and we deal only with degradations due to noise.

                        Noise tells unwanted information in digital images. Noise produces undesirable effects such as
                        artifacts, unrealistic edges, unseen lines, corners, blurred objects and disturbs background scenes.
                        To reduce these undesirable effects, prior learning of noise models is essential for further
                        processing. Digital noise may arise from various kinds of sources such as Charge Coupled Device
                        (CCD) and Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) sensors. In some sense, points
                        spreading function (PSF) and modulation transfer function (MTF) have been used for timely,
                        complete and quantitative analysis of noise models. Probability density function (PDF) or
                        Histogram is also used to design and characterize the noise models. Here we will discuss few
                        noise models, their types and categories in digital images. <br>
                        <b>1. Gaussian noise</b><br>
                        <p>
                            Gaussian noise provides a good model of noise in many imaging systems. Its probability density function (pdf) is: 
                            <div style="text-align: center">
                                <img src="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/VELDHUIZEN/img31.gif" class="img-fluid" width="80%" height="70%">
                                </div>
                                The Gaussian distribution has an important property: to estimate the mean of a stationary Gaussian random variable, one can't do any better than the linear average. This makes Gaussian noise a worst-case scenario for nonlinear image restoration filters, in the sense that the improvement over linear filters is least for Gaussian noise. To improve on linear filtering results, nonlinear filters can exploit only the non-Gaussianity of the signal distribution.
                        </p>
                        <b>2. Laplacian noise</b><br>
                        <p>
                            Laplacian noise (also called biexponential) which has this pdf:
                            <div style="text-align: center">
                                <img src="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/VELDHUIZEN/img32.gif" class="img-fluid" width="80%" height="70%"><br>
                                </div>
                                Nonlinear estimators can provide a much more accurate estimate of the mean of a stationary Laplacian random variable than the linear average.
                        </p>
                        <b>3. Uniform noise</b>
                        <p>
                            Uniform noise is not often encountered in real-world imaging systems, but provides a useful comparison with Gaussian noise. The linear average is a comparatively poor estimator for the mean of a uniform distribution. This implies that nonlinear filters should be better at removing uniform noise than Gaussian noise. The Uniform pdf is given by:

                    <h4>image registration</h4>
                    </p>
                        Image registration is an image processing technique used to align multiple scenes into a single integrated image. It helps overcome issues such as image rotation, scale, and skew that are common when overlaying images.<br>

                        Image registration is often used in medical and satellite imagery to align images from different camera sources. Digital cameras use image registration to align and connect adjacent images into a single panoramic image.

                    <p>
                        There are various restoration techniques as well as spatial
                         domain filter for noise removal. In spatial domain methods,
                        the technique operates directly on the pixels of an image. The
                        spatial domain methods are used for removing additive noise
                        only. Sometimes blur helps to increase photo’s expressiveness
                        but it decreases the quality of image unintentionally. In image
                        restoration, the improvement in the quality of the restored
                        image over the recorded blurred one is measured by the
                        signal-to-noise ratio improvement . Image restoration
                        techniques are used to make the corrupted image as similar as
                        that of the original image. Figure.3 shows classification of
                        restoration techniques. Basically, restoration techniques are
                        classified into blind restoration techniques and non-blind
                        restoration techniques . Non-blind restoration techniques
                        are further divided into linear restoration methods and nonlinear restoration method . <br>
                        Non-blind restoration techniques are described first in this
                        paper. A non-blind technique depends on the estimation of
                        PSF which should be priorly known. Based on PSF estimation
                        it restores the input image. As mentioned above other two
                        types of non-blind techniques are linear restoration methods
                        such as Weiner filter, Inverse filter, and Constrained Least
                        square filter. Lucy-Richardson algorithm is a Non-linear type
                        of restoration method.
