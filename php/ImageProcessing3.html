                    <p>The color that humans perceived in an object are  determined by the nature of the light reflected from the  object
                        Light is electromagnetic spectrum.<br>

                        </div>
                    <b>Visible light</b>
                    Visible light is composed of a relatively narrow band of  frequencies in the ES.<br>
Human color perceive is a composition of different  wavelength spectrum<br>
The color of	an object is a body that favours reflectance  in a limited range of visible spectrum exhibits some  shade of colors<br>
Example
White: a body that reflects light that balanced in all visible  wavelengths<br>
. E.g. green objects reflect light with wavelength primarily in the  500 to 570 nm range while absorbing most of the energy at other  wavelengths.<br><b>Characterization of light</b>
If the light achromatic (void of color), if its only attribute is  intensity. Gray level refers to a scalar measure of  intensity that ranges from black, to grays, and finally to  white<br>
Chromatic light spans the ES from about 400 to 700 nm<br>
Three basic quantities are used to describe the quality of  a chromatic light source<br>
Radiance: total amount of energy flows from the light  source<br>
Luminance: amount of energy perceive from light source<br>
Brightness: a subjective descriptor that is practically  impossible to measure
<br>
                        Colors are seen as variable combinations of the primary color s of light: red (R), green (G), and blue (B). The primary colors can be mixed to produce the secondary colors: magenta (red+blue), cyan (green+blue), and yellow (red+green). Mixing the three primaries, or a secondary with its opposite primary color, produces white light.<br>

                        However, the primary colors of pigments are cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y), and the secondary colors are red, green, and blue. A proper combination of the three pigment primaries, or a secondary with its opposite primary, produces black.

                    <p>
                        Full-color image processing approaches fall into two major categories:<br>
                        ‚Ä¢	Approaches that process each component image individually and then form a composite processed color image from the individually processed components.<br>
                        ‚Ä¢	Approaches that work with color pixels directly.<br>
                        In full-color images, color pixels really are vectors. For example, in the RGB system, each color pixel can be expressed as<br>
                        <div class="borderr">

                    <h4 id="two">Color models and color spaces</h4>
                    <h4>Color models</h4>
                    <p>
                        A color model is an abstract mathematical model that describes how colors can be represented as a set of numbers (e.g., a triple in RGB or a quad in CMYK). Color models can usually be described using a coordinate system, and each color in the system is represented by a single point in the coordinate space.<br>

                        For a given color model, to interpret a tuple or quad as a color, we can define a set of rules and definitions used to accurately calibrate and generate colors, i.e. a mapping function. A color space identifies a specific combination of color models and mapping functions. Identifying the color space automatically identifies the associated color model. For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different color spaces, both based on the RGB color model.<br>
                        <b>Color Models:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>RGB</li>
                            <li>CMY</li>
                            <li>CMYK</li>
                            <li>HSV</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h4>color spaces</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Image Processing Toolbox‚Ñ¢ software typically represents colors as red, green, and blue (RGB) numeric values. However, there are other models besides RGB for representing colors numerically. The various models are referred to as color spaces because most of them can be mapped into a 2-D, 3-D, or 4-D coordinate system.<br>
                        The various color spaces exist because they present color information in ways that make certain calculations more convenient or because they provide a way to identify colors that is more intuitive. For example, the RGB color space defines a color as the percentages of red, green, and blue hues mixed together. Other color models describe colors by their hue (shade of color), saturation (amount of gray or pure color), and luminance (intensity, or overall brightness).
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="three">RGB color model, HSV color model, CMY color model</h4>
                    <h4>RGB color model</h4>
                    <p>
                        RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue colors are mixed together in various proportions to form a different array of colors. The name was given with the first letters of three primary colors red, green and blue. In this model, colors are prepared by adding components, with white having all colors in it and black without the presence of any color. RGB color model is used in various digital displays like TV and video displays, Computer displays, digital cameras, and other light-based display devices.

                    <h4>HSV color model</h4>
                    <p>
                        HSV is a cylindrical color model that remaps the RGB primary colors into dimensions that are easier for humans to understand. Like the Munsell Color System, these dimensions are hue, saturation, and value.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hue specifies the angle of the color on the RGB color circle. A 0¬∞ hue results in red, 120¬∞ results in green, and 240¬∞ results in blue.</li>
                            <li>Saturation controls the amount of color used. A color with 100% saturation will be the purest color possible, while 0% saturation yields grayscale.</li>
                            <li>Value controls the brightness of the color. A color with 0% brightness is pure black while a color with 100% brightness has no black mixed into the color. Because this dimension is often referred to as brightness, the HSV color model is sometimes called HSB, including in P5.js.</li>

                    <h4>CMY color model</h4>
                    <p>
                        The model is a subtractive color model in which cyan, magenta and yellow pigments or dyes are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three subtractive primary colors: cyan, magenta, and yellow.<br>

The CMY color model itself does not define what is meant by cyan, magenta and yellow colorimetrically, and so the results of mixing them are not specified as absolute, but relative to the primary colors. When the exact chromaticities of the cyan, magenta, and yellow primaries are defined, the color model then becomes an absolute color space.

                    <h4>Pseudo color image processing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Pseudo-color processing is a technique that maps each of the grey levels of a black and white image into an assigned color. This colored image, when displayed, can make the identification of certain features easier for the observer. The mappings are computationally simple and fast. This makes pseudo-color an attractive technique for use on digital image processing systems that are designed to be used in the interactive mode. This paper will discuss the application of several pseudo-color mapping schemes. Various color maps can give contrast enhancement effects, contouring effects, or grey level mapping (depicting areas of a given grey level). Pseudo-color schemes can also be designed to preserve or remove intensity information. Since the nature of the original black and white image can determine the success or failure of a particular color scheme, it is necessary to find a rational approach to the design and selection of the color maps.
