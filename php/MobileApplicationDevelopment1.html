                    <p>
                       Mobile Programming is simply a programming which is done to develop a mobile application.<br><br>
                       <b>Mobile Development</b><br>
                       Mobile application development is the process to making software for smartphones and digital assistants, most commonly for Android and iOS. The software can be preinstalled on the device, downloaded from a mobile app store or accessed through a mobile web browser. The programming and markup languages used for this kind of software development include Java, Swift, C# and HTML5.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="three">Overview of the Operating Systems used on different mobile 
                        devices </h4>
                    <p>A mobile operating system is an operating system that helps to run other application software on mobile devices. It is the same kind of software as the famous computer operating systems like Linux and Windows, but now they are light and simple to some extent.<br>

                    The operating systems found on smartphones include Symbian OS, iPhone OS, RIM's BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, Palm WebOS, Android, and Maemo. Android, WebOS, and Maemo are all derived from Linux. The iPhone OS originated from BSD and NeXTSTEP, which are related to Unix.<br>
                            
                    It combines the beauty of computer and hand use devices. It typically contains a cellular built-in modem and SIM tray for telephony and internet connections. If you buy a mobile, the manufacturer company chooses the OS for that specific device.</p>
                    <p>

                    <h4 id="four">Android Operating System, Its Features and Versions</h4>
                    <p>
                        Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a partnership of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance and commercially sponsored by Google. It was disclosed in November 2007, with the first commercial Android device, the HTC Dream, launched in September 2008.<br>

                        It is free and open-source software. Its source code is Android Open Source Project (AOSP), primarily licensed under the Apache License. However, most Android devices dispatch with additional proprietary software pre-installed, mainly Google Mobile Services (GMS), including core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution platform Google Play and the associated Google Play Services development platform.

                    <p>
                        <b>Features of Android</b><br>
                        <span><b>1. Near Field Communication (NFC)</b></span><br>
                        <p>Most Android devices support NFC, which allows electronic devices to interact across short distances easily. The main goal here is to create a payment option that is simpler than carrying cash or credit cards, and while the market hasn't exploded as many experts had predicted, there may be an alternative in the works, in the form of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).</p>
                                
                        <span><b>2. Infrared Transmission</b></span><br>
                         <p>The Android operating system supports a built-in infrared transmitter that allows you to use your phone or tablet as a remote control.</p>
                              
                         <span><b>3. Automation</b></span><br>
                         <p>The Tasker app allows control of app permissions and also automates them.</p>
                               
                        <span><b>4. Wireless App Downloads</b></span><br>
                        <p>You can download apps on your PC by using the Android Market or third-party options like AppBrain. Then it automatically syncs them to your Droid, and no plugging is required.</p>
                                
                        <span><b>5. Storage and Battery Swap</b></span><br>
                        <p>Android phones also have unique hardware capabilities. Google's OS makes it possible to upgrade, replace, and remove your battery that no longer holds a charge. In addition, Android phones come with SD card slots for expandable storage.</p>    
                        <span><b>6. Custom Home Screens</b></span><br>
                        <p>While it's possible to hack certain phones to customize the home screen, Android comes with this capability from the get-go. Download a third-party launcher like Apex, Nova, and you can add gestures, new shortcuts, or even performance enhancements for older-model devices.</p> 
                        <span><b>7. Widgets</b></span><br>
                        <p>Apps are versatile, but sometimes you want information at a glance instead of having to open an app and wait for it to load. Android widgets let you display just about any feature you choose on the home screen, including weather apps, music widgets, or productivity tools that helpfully remind you of upcoming meetings or approaching deadlines.</p>  
                        <span><b>8. Custom ROMs</b></span><br>
                        <p>Because the Android operating system is open-source, developers can twist the current OS and build their versions, which users can download and install in place of the stock OS. Some are filled with features, while others change the look and feel of a device. Chances are, if there's a feature you want, someone has already built a custom ROM for it.</p>
