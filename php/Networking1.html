                        <p>Computer Network Architecture is defined as the physical and logical design of the software, hardware, protocols, and media of the transmission of data. Simply we can say that how computers are organized and how tasks are allocated to the computer.</p>

                            <p>A peer to peer network is a simple network of computers. It first came into existence in the late 1970s. Here each computer acts as a node for file sharing within the formed network. Here each node acts as a server and thus there is no central server to the network. This allows the sharing of a huge amount of data. The tasks are equally divided amongst the nodes. Each node connected in the network shares an equal workload. For the network to stop working, all the nodes need to individually stop working. This is because each node works independently.</p>

                                A server is simply a computer that provides the network resources and provides service to other computers when they request it. A client is the computer running a program that requests the service from a server. Local area network (LAN) is based on client server network relationship.<br>
                                A client-server network is one on which all available network resources such as files, directories, applications and shared devices, are centrally managed and hosted and then are accessed by the client.<br>
                                Client server networks are defined by the presence of servers on a network that provide security and administration of the network.

                        <p>
                            <b>Protocol </b>
                            <p>A protocol is a set of rules and conventions agreed upon and followed by the communicating entities for data communication. A protocol outlines the what, how and when of a communication.
                                <br>
                                The three aspects of a protocol are −
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Syntax -</b> It defines the format of data that is to be sent or received.</li>
                                    <li><b>Semantics -</b>It defines the meaning of each section of bits that are transferred.</li>
                                    <li><b>Timings -</b>It defines the time at which data is transferred as well as the speed at which it is transferred.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            <b>Protocol Hierarchies</b>
                            <p>Most networks are organized as a stack of layers, one on the top of another. The number of layers and their names vary from network to network. Each layer has a specified function and adheres to specified protocols. Thus we obtain a stack of protocols.</p>
                            <p>The following figure illustrates a four-layer network −
                            <div style="text-align: center">
                            <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assets/questions/images/161754-1531472804.png" class="img-fluid"><br>
                            </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The above figure represents communication between Device A and Device B. The data stream from one device to the other is not sent directly but has to pass through a number of layers. The layers in the same levels are called peers and have a set of protocols for communication. Between each adjacent layer is an interface that defines the services that are being offered by a lower layer to the next higher layer. The dotted arrows depict virtual communication between peer layers, while the solid arrows represent the physical communications between the adjacent layers.<br>

                            Let us consider a situation where Device A wants to send a message to Device B. Device A passes its information to the highest layer. As soon as a data stream reaches a layer, it performs some specified functions on it and passes it to the layer below. This continues until the data stream reaches the lowest layer. Layer 1 passes a bit stream of 0s and 1s to the physical medium that communicates it to the Layer 1 of the receiving end. Each layer in the receiving end performs certain functions on the data stream adhering to the protocol with its peer and passes it to the layer above. This continues until the information reaches the highest layer. The highest layer then conveys the message to Device B in the same format sent by Device A.

                        <h4 id="three">Reference Model</h4>

                            It is a conceptual layout mainly used to describe how the communication between devices should occur.<br>Reference models define which functions should be performed at each layer of the model and thus they promote standardization.

                            <b>I. OSI reference model</b><br>
                            <p>OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It has been developed by ISO – ‘International Organization for Standardization‘, in the year 1984. It is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe. </p>

                            <span><b>1. The application layer</b></span>
                            <p>This is the only layer that directly interacts with data from the user. Software applications like web browsers and email clients rely on the application layer to initiate communications. But it should be made clear that client software applications are not part of the application layer; rather the application layer is responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that the software relies on to present meaningful data to the user. Application layer protocols include HTTP as well as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is one of the protocols that enables email communications).</p>
                            <span><b>2. The presentation layer</b></span>
                            <p>This layer is primarily responsible for preparing data so that it can be used by the application layer; in other words, layer 6 makes the data presentable for applications to consume. The presentation layer is responsible for translation, encryption, and compression of data.<br>

                                Two communicating devices communicating may be using different encoding methods, so layer 6 is responsible for translating incoming data into a syntax that the application layer of the receiving device can understand.<br>
                                
                                If the devices are communicating over an encrypted connection, layer 6 is responsible for adding the encryption on the sender’s end as well as decoding the encryption on the receiver's end so that it can present the application layer with unencrypted, readable data.<br>
                                
                                Finally the presentation layer is also responsible for compressing data it receives from the application layer before delivering it to layer 5. This helps improve the speed and efficiency of communication by minimizing the amount of data that will be transferred.</p>
                            <span><b>3. The session layer</b></span>
                            <p>This is the layer responsible for opening and closing communication between the two devices. The time between when the communication is opened and closed is known as the session. The session layer ensures that the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged, and then promptly closes the session in order to avoid wasting resources.<br>

                                The session layer also synchronizes data transfer with checkpoints. For example, if a 100 megabyte file is being transferred, the session layer could set a checkpoint every 5 megabytes. In the case of a disconnect or a crash after 52 megabytes have been transferred, the session could be resumed from the last checkpoint, meaning only 50 more megabytes of data need to be transferred. Without the checkpoints, the entire transfer would have to begin again from scratch.</p>
                            <span><b>4. The transport layer</b></span>
                            <p>Layer 4 is responsible for end-to-end communication between the two devices. This includes taking data from the session layer and breaking it up into chunks called segments before sending it to layer 3. The transport layer on the receiving device is responsible for reassembling the segments into data the session layer can consume.<br>

                                The transport layer is also responsible for flow control and error control. Flow control determines an optimal speed of transmission to ensure that a sender with a fast connection doesn’t overwhelm a receiver with a slow connection. The transport layer performs error control on the receiving end by ensuring that the data received is complete, and requesting a retransmission if it isn’t.</p>
                            <span><b>5. The network layer</b></span>
                            <p>The network layer is responsible for facilitating data transfer between two different networks. If the two devices communicating are on the same network, then the network layer is unnecessary. The network layer breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units, called packets, on the sender’s device, and reassembling these packets on the receiving device. The network layer also finds the best physical path for the data to reach its destination; this is known as routing.</p>
                            <span><b>6. The data link layer</b></span>
                            <p>The data link layer is very similar to the network layer, except the data link layer facilitates data transfer between two devices on the SAME network. The data link layer takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller pieces called frames. Like the network layer, the data link layer is also responsible for flow control and error control in intra-network communication (The transport layer only does flow control and error control for inter-network communications).
                            </p>
                            <span><b>7. The physical layer</b></span>
                            <p>This layer includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables and switches. This is also the layer where the data gets converted into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s. The physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1s can be distinguished from the 0s on both devices.</p>
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            <b>II. TCP/IP model</b>
                            <p>The TCP/IP model was developed prior to the OSI model.
                                The TCP/IP model is not exactly similar to the OSI model.
                                The TCP/IP model consists of five layers: the application layer, transport layer, network layer, data link layer and physical layer.
                                The first four layers provide physical standards, network interface, internetworking, and transport functions that correspond to the first four layers of the OSI model and these four layers are represented in TCP/IP model by a single layer called the application layer.
                                TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules, and each of them provides specific functionality.
                                Here, hierarchical means that each upper-layer protocol is supported by two or more lower-level protocols.

                                <span><b>1. Network Access Layer</b></span>
                                <p>A network layer is the lowest layer of the TCP/IP model.
                                    A network layer is the combination of the Physical layer and Data Link layer defined in the OSI reference model.
                                    It defines how the data should be sent physically through the network.
                                    This layer is mainly responsible for the transmission of the data between two devices on the same network.
                                    The functions carried out by this layer are encapsulating the IP datagram into frames transmitted by the network and mapping of IP addresses into physical addresses.
                                    The protocols used by this layer are ethernet, token ring, FDDI, X.25, frame relay.</p>
                                <span><b>2. Internet Layer</b></span>
                                <p>t is the second layer of the TCP/IP model and this layer is parallel to the Network Layer of the OSI Model, in terms of the structure
                                    Sending the data packets to their destination network is the main function of the Internet layer
                                    The logical transmission of data takes place at this level<br>
                                    There are three different protocols used in this layer. These include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>IP: </b>One of the most important protocols as it detects the IP address of a device which is later used for internetwork connections. It is using this protocol that the path with which the data shall be transmitted is decided.There are two common IP versions which are used IPv4 and IPv6</li>
                                        <li><b>ARP: </b>It stands for Address Resolution Protocol. The physical address from the IP address can be determined using ARP. </li>
                                        <li><b>ICMP: </b>It stands for Internet Control Message Protocol and notification regarding datagram problems can be sent back to the user using this. Any issue with the network is immediately notified to the user by ICMP. It can only inform the user about the errors and cannot rectify the problem.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <span><b>3. Transport Layer</b></span>
                                <p>
                                    This layer is analogous to the transport layer of the OSI model. It is responsible for end-to-end communication and error-free delivery of data. It shields the upper-layer applications from the complexities of data. The two main protocols present in this layer are :<br>
                                    <span>1. <b>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) – </b>It is known to provide reliable and error-free communication between end systems. It performs sequencing and segmentation of data. It also has acknowledgment feature and controls the flow of the data through flow control mechanism. It is a very effective protocol but has a lot of overhead due to such features. Increased overhead leads to increased cost.</span><br>
                                    <span>2. <b>User Datagram Protocol (UDP) – </b>On the other hand does not provide any such features. It is the go-to protocol if your application does not require reliable transport as it is very cost-effective. Unlike TCP, which is connection-oriented protocol, UDP is connectionless.</span>
                                </p>
                                <span><b>4. Application Layer</b></span>
                                <p>
                                    The topic three layers of the OSI Model: Application, Presentation and Sessions, when combined together, they perform similar functions as the Application Layer of the TCP/IP model.
                                    node-to-node communication based on the user-interface occurs here.<br>
                                    Multiple protocols are present in this layer, a few common ones have been mentioned below in brief:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>HTTP:</b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to manage the communication between the server and web browsers.</li>
                                        <li><b>NTP:</b>Network Time Protocol can set one standard time source in our computer, which enables sync between the server and the user.</li>
                                        <li><b>TELNET:</b>Telecommunication Network is used to have access to files present of the Telnet network and manage them on internet.</li>
                                        <li><b>FTP:</b>File Transfer Protocol, as the name suggests allows easy transferring of files.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                            </p>
                        </p>
                        <h4 id="four">Connection oriented & Connectionless Services</h4>
                        
                        <p>
                            <b>1. Connection-Oriented Service</b><br>
                            A connection-oriented service is a network service that was designed and developed after the telephone system. A connection-oriented service is used to create an end to end connection between the sender and the receiver before transmitting the data over the same or different networks. In connection-oriented service, packets are transmitted to the receiver in the same order the sender has sent them. It uses a handshake method that creates a connection between the user and sender for transmitting the data over the network. Hence it is also known as a reliable network service.<br>
                            Suppose, a sender wants to send data to the receiver. Then, first, the sender sends a request packet to a receiver in the form of an SYN packet. After that, the receiver responds to the sender's request with an (SYN-ACK) signal/packets. That represents the confirmation is received by the receiver to start the communication between the sender and the receiver. Now a sender can send the message or data to the receiver.<br>
                            Similarly, a receiver can respond or send the data to the sender in the form of packets. After successfully exchanging or transmitting data, a sender can terminate the connection by sending a signal to the receiver. In this way, we can say that it is a reliable network service.<br>
                            <b>Ex: </b>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that allows communication between two or more computer devices by establishing connections in the same or different networks. It is the most important protocol that uses internet protocol to transfer the data from one end to another. Hence, it is sometimes referred to as TCP/IP. It ensures that the connection is established and maintained until the data packet is transferring between the sender and receiver is complete.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>2. Connectionless Service</b><br>
                            A connection is similar to a postal system, in which each letter takes along different route paths from the source to the destination address. Connectionless service is used in the network system to transfer data from one end to another end without creating any connection. So it does not require establishing a connection before sending the data from the sender to the receiver. It is not a reliable network service because it does not guarantee the transfer of data packets to the receiver, and data packets can be received in any order to the receiver. Therefore we can say that the data packet does not follow a defined path. In connectionless service, the transmitted data packet is not received by the receiver due to network congestion, and the data may be lost.<br>
                            For example, a sender can directly send any data to the receiver without establishing any connection because it is a connectionless service. Data sent by the sender will be in the packet or data streams containing the receiver's address. In connectionless service, the data can be travelled and received in any order. However, it does not guarantee to transfer of the packets to the right destination.<br>
                            <b>Ex: </b>The UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that allows communication between two or more devices without establishing any connection. In this protocol, a sender sends the data packets to the receiver that holds the destination address. A UDP does not ensure to deliver the data packets to the correct destination, and it does not generate any acknowledgment about the sender's data. Similarly, it does not acknowledge the receiver about the data. Hence, it is an unreliable protocol.<br>
                        </p>
                        <h4 id="five">IP Address</h4>
                        <p>
                            All the computers of the world in the Internet network communicate with each other with underground or underwater cables or wirelessly. If I want to download a file from the internet or load a web page or literally do anything related to the internet, my computer must have an address so that other computers can find and locate mine in order to deliver that particular file or webpage that I am requesting. In technical terms, that address is called IP Address or Internet Protocol Address.<br>
                            <b>Ex: </b>if someone wants to send you a mail then he/she must have your home address. Similarly, your computer too needs an address so that other computers on the internet can communicate with each other without the confusion of delivering information to someone else’s computer. And that is why each computer in this world has a unique IP Address. Or in other words, an IP address is a unique address that is used to identify computers or nodes on the internet. This address is just a string of numbers written in a certain format. It is generally expressed in the set of numbers for example 192.155.12.1. Here each number in the set is from 0 to 255 range. Or we can say that a full IP address ranges from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. And these IP addresses are assign by IANA(known as Internet Corporation For Internet Assigned Numbers Authority). 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Types of IP Address:</b><br>IP Address is of two types: <br>
                            <p>1. <b>IPv4:</b>Internet Protocol version 4. It consists of 4 numbers separated by the dots. Each number can be from 0-255 in decimal numbers. But computers do not understand decimal numbers, they instead change them to binary numbers which are only 0 and 1. Therefore, in binary, this (0-255) range can be written as (00000000 – 11111111). Since each number N can be represented by a group of 8 digit binary digits. So, a whole IPv4 binary address can be represented by 32-bits of binary digits. In IPv4, a unique sequence of bits is assigned to a computer, so a total of (2^32) devices approximately = 4,294,967,296 can be assigned with IPv4. 
                            <br>IPv4 can be written as:<br>189.123.123.90
                            </p>
                            <p>2. <b>IPv6:</b>there is a problem with the IPv4 address. With IPv4, we can connect only the above number of 4 billion devices uniquely, and apparently, there are much more devices in the world to be connected to the internet. So, gradually we are making our way to IPv6 Address which is a 128-bit IP address. In human-friendly form, IPv6 is written as a group of 8 hexadecimal numbers separated with colons(:). But in the computer-friendly form, it can be written as 128 bits of 0s and 1s. Since, a unique sequence of binary digits is given to computers, smartphones, and other devices to be connected to the internet. So, via IPv6 a total of (2^128) devices can be assigned with unique addresses which are actually more than enough for upcoming future generations.
                            <br>IPv6 can be written as:<br>2011:0bd9:75c5:0000:0000:6b3e:0170:8394

                            <p>Local Area Network is a group of computers connected to each other in a small area such as building, office.
                                LAN is used for connecting two or more personal computers through a communication medium such as twisted pair, coaxial cable, etc.
                                It is less costly as it is built with inexpensive hardware such as hubs, network adapters, and ethernet cables.
                                The data is transferred at an extremely faster rate in Local Area Network.
                                Local Area Network provides higher security.
