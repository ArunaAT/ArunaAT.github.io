                        <span><b>1. Linux kernel</b></span><br>
                        <p>It is the heart of android architecture that exists at the root of android architecture. Linux kernel is responsible for device drivers, power management, memory management, device management and resource access.</p>
                        <span><b>2. Native Libraries</b></span><br>
                        <p>On the top of linux kernel, their are Native libraries such as WebKit, OpenGL, FreeType, SQLite, Media, C runtime library (libc) etc.<br>The WebKit library is responsible for browser support, SQLite is for database, FreeType for font support, Media for playing and recording audio and video formats.</p>
                        <span><b>3. Android Runtime</b></span><br>
                        <p>In android runtime, there are core libraries and DVM (Dalvik Virtual Machine) which is responsible to run android application. DVM is like JVM but it is optimized for mobile devices. It consumes less memory and provides fast performance.</p>
                        <span><b>4. Android Framework</b></span><br>
                        <p>On the top of Native libraries and android runtime, there is android framework. Android framework includes Android API's such as UI (User Interface), telephony, resources, locations, Content Providers (data) and package managers. It provides a lot of classes and interfaces for android application development.</p>
                        <span><b>5. Applications</b></span><br>
                        <p>On the top of android framework, there are applications. All applications such as home, contact, settings, games, browsers are using android framework that uses android runtime and libraries. Android runtime and native libraries are using linux kernal.</p>

                        Below are the steps to start and set up a new android project in Android Studio.<br>
                        <span><b>Step 1</b></span><br>
                        <p>
                            Select the first option to start a new android project.
                            <div style="text-align: center">

                              </div>
                        </p>
                        <span><b>Step 2</b></span><br>
                        <p>
                            Then, name your application in the ‘Application name‘ Text box.
                          <div style="text-align: center">
                            <img src="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/2-23.png" class="img-fluid"><br>
                          </div><br>
                          By default, the application name appears as “MyApplication”. Click on “Next” after filling the Application name field, leaving the other fields to their default values.<br>
                        </p>
                        <span><b>Step 3</b></span><br>
                        <p>
                            Then select the Minimum SDK to select the operating system which must be least version to run your app, here “Jelly Bean” is made Minimum SDK, and phones and tablets with versions lower to this OS will not be able to run your apps. Click on “Next”.
                          <div style="text-align: center">

                        <span><b>Step 4</b></span><br>
                        <p>
                            The next step is to choose the Activity to mobile. Activity in Android refers to a single screen with a user interface. For Beginners, “Empty Activity” is recommended.
                          <div style="text-align: center">

                        <p>
                            Then, fill the Activity name text field. By default, “MainActivity” is filled in this text box as the name of your activity. In android studio, files are usually named in camel case. An xml file of the activity is created using the first word in the Activity name. An xml file is a file to provide functionalities of user interface for our app.
                          <div style="text-align: center">

                        <p>
                          Now, browse the location where you want to install the Android Studio and click "Next" to proceed.

                        <p>
                            Then, a default app is created with all default files. And you can now start writing the application code.

                    <p>
                        The AndroidManifest.xml file contains information of your package, including components of the application such as activities, services, broadcast receivers, content providers etc.<br>
                        It performs some other tasks also:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is responsible to protect the application to access any protected parts by providing the permissions.</li>
                            <li>It also declares the android api that the application is going to use.</li>
                            <li>It lists the instrumentation classes. The instrumentation classes provides profiling and other informations. These informations are removed just before the application is published etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        This is the required xml file for all the android application and located inside the root directory.

                            application is the subelement of the manifest. It includes the namespace declaration. This element contains several subelements that declares the application component such as activity etc.<br><br>

                            The commonly used attributes are of this element are icon, label, theme etc.<br><br>

                            <b>android:icon</b> represents the icon for all the android application components.<br>

                            <b>android:label</b> works as the default label for all the application components.<br>

                            <b>android:theme</b> represents a common theme for all the android activities.
                        </p>

                    </p>
                    <h4 id="four">Understanding Activities</h4>
                    <p>
                        The mobile-app experience differs from its desktop counterpart in that a user's interaction with the app doesn't always begin in the same place. Instead, the user journey often begins non-deterministically. For instance, if you open an email app from your home screen, you might see a list of emails. By contrast, if you are using a social media app that then launches your email app, you might go directly to the email app's screen for composing an email.<br>

                        The Activity class is designed to facilitate this paradigm. When one app invokes another, the calling app invokes an activity in the other app, rather than the app as an atomic whole. In this way, the activity serves as the entry point for an app's interaction with the user. You implement an activity as a subclass of the Activity class.<br>

                        An activity provides the window in which the app draws its UI. This window typically fills the screen, but may be smaller than the screen and float on top of other windows. Generally, one activity implements one screen in an app. For instance, one of an app’s activities may implement a Preferences screen, while another activity implements a Select Photo screen.<br>

                        Most apps contain multiple screens, which means they comprise multiple activities. Typically, one activity in an app is specified as the main activity, which is the first screen to appear when the user launches the app. Each activity can then start another activity in order to perform different actions. For example, the main activity in a simple e-mail app may provide the screen that shows an e-mail inbox. From there, the main activity might launch other activities that provide screens for tasks like writing e-mails and opening individual e-mails.<br>

                        Although activities work together to form a cohesive user experience in an app, each activity is only loosely bound to the other activities; there are usually minimal dependencies among the activities in an app. In fact, activities often start up activities belonging to other apps. For example, a browser app might launch the Share activity of a social-media app.<br>

                        To use activities in your app, you must register information about them in the app’s manifest, and you must manage activity lifecycles appropriately. The rest of this document introduces these subjects.<br>
