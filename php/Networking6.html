                    <p>
                        A wide area network (WAN) is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area. Wide area networks are often established with leased telecommunication circuits.<br>

                        Businesses, as well as schools and government entities, use wide area networks to relay data to staff, students, clients, buyers and suppliers from various locations around the world. In essence, this mode of telecommunication allows a business to effectively carry out its daily function regardless of location. The Internet may be considered a WAN. <br><br>
                        <b>WAN Devices</b><br>
                        <span><b>Modems</b></span>
                        <p>
                            Modems enables digital data to be sent over an analog medium during transmission and receiving of information.<br>
                            A voice band modem converts the digital signals produced by a computer – the 1s and 0s- into voice frequencies that can be transmitted over the analog lines of the telephone network. On the other side of the connection, another modem converts the sounds back into a digital signal for input to a computer or network connection.
                        </p>
                        <span><b>Access server</b></span>
                        <p>
                            Concentrates dial-in and dial-out user communications. An access server may have a mixture of analog and digital interfaces and support hundreds of simultaneous users.
                        </p>
                        <span><b>WAN Switch</b></span>
                        <p>
                            A multi-port internetworking device used in carrier networks. These devices typically switch traffic such as ATM, and operate at the Data Link layer of the OSI reference model. Public switched telephone network switches may also be used within the cloud for circuit-switched connections like Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) or analog dial-up.
                        </p>
                        <span><b>Router</b></span>
                        <p>
                            A Router Provides internetworking between the LANs, and WAN access interface ports that are used to connect to the service provider network. These interfaces may be serial connections or other WAN interfaces. With some types of WAN interfaces, an external device such as a DSU/CSU or modem (Analogue, Cable, or DSL) is required to connect the router to the local point of presence (POP) of the service provider.
                        </p>

                    <p>                     
                        Circuit-Switched Network – a type of network where the communications between end devices (nodes) must be set up before they can communicate. Once set up, the “circuit” is dedicated to the two nodes it connects for the duration of that connection. An example of a circuit-switched network is an analog telephone network.<br><br>
                        <b>Circuit-Switched WANs</b><br>
                        <span><b>1. ISDN</b></span>
                        <p>ISDN or Integrated Services Digital Network is a circuit-switched telephone network system that transmits both data and voice over a digital line. You can also think of it as a set of communication standards to transmit data, voice, and signaling.<br>
                        These digital lines could be copper lines. It was designed to move outdated landline technology to digital.<br>
                            
                        ISDN connections have a reputation for providing better speeds and higher quality than traditional connections. Faster speeds and better connections allow data transmissions to travel more reliably.</p>
                        <span><b>2. POTS</b></span>
                        <p>POTS merely stands for ‘Plain Old Telephone Service’. But initially, POTS was the acronym for ‘Post Office Telephone Service’. A simple reason was that, at that time, the post office was the sole source of communication of point A to point B.<br>
                        POTS is an old system of communication. In POTS, analog voice transmission takes place over a pair of twisted copper wire. This system has its roots from ancient times and thus, must be known to everyone.</p>
                        <span><b>3. PSTN</b></span>
                        <p>STN is an acronym for ‘Public Switched Telephone Network’ and it is a sort of system in which the telephones pertain to the assigned networks.
                            In moral terms, in PSTN, there are telephone numbers allotted to each telephone, one at the receiving end and one at the transmitting end (both numbers are unique!) and for any sort of communication between two individuals at either end, either of them should know the correct number of the other.</p>
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="three">Leased Lines, Packet-Switched WANs </h4><br>
                    <h4>Leased Lines</h4>
                    <p>
                        A leased line is a private telecommunications circuit between two or more locations provided according to a commercial contract. It is sometimes also known as a private circuit, and as a data line in the UK. Typically, leased lines are used by businesses to connect geographically distant offices.<br>

                        Unlike traditional telephone lines in the public switched telephone network (PSTN) leased lines are generally not switched circuits, and therefore do not have an associated telephone number. Each side of the line is permanently connected, always active and dedicated to the other. Leased lines can be used for telephone, Internet, or other data communication services. Some are ringdown services, and some connect to a private branch exchange (PBX) or network router.<br>

                        The primary factors affecting the recurring lease fees are the distance between end stations and the bandwidth of the circuit. Since the connection does not carry third-party communications, the carrier can assure a specified level of quality.<br>

                        An Internet leased line is a premium Internet connectivity product, normally delivered over fiber, which provides uncontended, symmetrical bandwidth with full-duplex traffic. It is also known as an Ethernet leased line, dedicated line, data circuit or private line.

                    <h4>Packet-Switched WANs</h4>
                    <p>
                        <span><b>1. ADSL</b></span>
                        <p>Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) is a type of DSL broadband communications technology used for connecting to the Internet. ADSL allows more data to be sent over existing copper telephone lines (POTS), when compared to traditional modem lines. A special filter, called a microfilter, is installed on a subscriber’s telephone line to allow both ADSL and regular voice (telephone) services to be used at the same time.<br>
                        ADSL requires a special ADSL modem and subscribers must be in close geographical locations to the provider’s central office to receive ADSL service. Typically this distance is within a radius of 2 to 2.5 miles. ADSL supports data rates of from 1.5 to 9 Mbps when receiving data (known as the downstream rate) and from 16 to 640 Kbps when sending data (known as the upstream rate).</p>
                        <span><b>2. ATM</b></span>
                        <p>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is an International Telecommunication Union- Telecommunications Standards Section (ITU-T) efficient for call relay and it transmits all information including multiple service types such as data, video, or voice which is conveyed in small fixed-size packets called cells. Cells are transmitted asynchronously and the network is connection-oriented. <br>

                            ATM is a technology that has some event in the development of broadband ISDN in the 1970s and 1980s, which can be considered an evolution of packet switching. Each cell is 53 bytes long – 5 bytes header and 48 bytes payload. Making an ATM call requires first sending a message to set up a connection. 
                            <br>
                            Subsequently, all cells follow the same path to the destination. It can handle both constant rate traffic and variable rate traffic. Thus it can carry multiple types of traffic with end-to-end quality of service. ATM is independent of a transmission medium, they may be sent on a wire or fiber by themselves or they may also be packaged inside the payload of other carrier systems. ATM networks use “Packet” or “cell” Switching with virtual circuits. Its design helps in the implementation of high-performance multimedia networking. </p>
                        <span><b>3. Frame Relay</b></span>
                        <p>Frame Relay is a packet switching technology that fragmented into transmission units called frames and sent in high-speed bursts through a digital network. Establishes an exclusive connection during the transmission period called virtual connection.<br>

                        It uses a technology called fast packet in which error checking does not occur in any intermediate node of the transmission but done at the ends. It makes it more efficient than X.25, and a higher process speed achieved (it can transmit over 2,044 Mbps).<br>
                            
                        Another advantage is that you need less powerful switching centers (nodes) and with less memory capacity than those needed by X25 (each X25 switching center uses the receive-store-check-relay method, while Frame Relay does not need checking or correcting errors).</p>

                    <h4 id="five">Cloud Computing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.<br>

                        Rather than keeping files on a proprietary hard drive or local storage device, cloud-based storage makes it possible to save them to a remote database. As long as an electronic device has access to the web, it has access to the data and the software programs to run it.<br>

                        Cloud computing is a popular option for people and businesses for a number of reasons including cost savings, increased productivity, speed and efficiency, performance, and security.<br>
                        Cloud computing is named as such because the information being accessed is found remotely in the cloud or a virtual space. Companies that provide cloud services enable users to store files and applications on remote servers and then access all the data via the Internet. This means the user is not required to be in a specific place to gain access to it, allowing the user to work remotely.<br>

                        Cloud computing takes all the heavy lifting involved in crunching and processing data away from the device you carry around or sit and work at. It also moves all of that work to huge computer clusters far away in cyberspace. The Internet becomes the cloud, and voilà—your data, work, and applications are available from any device with which you can connect to the Internet, anywhere in the world.<br>

                        Cloud computing can be both public and private. Public cloud services provide their services over the Internet for a fee. Private cloud services, on the other hand, only provide services to a certain number of people. These services are a system of networks that supply hosted services. There is also a hybrid option, which combines elements of both the public and private services.
